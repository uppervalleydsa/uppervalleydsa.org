### Developing

You'll need:

- Node
- Yarn
- `libvips`, for image processing

I recommend developing on a macOS system using Homebrew. You can install and configure these requirements with:

```
brew install node yarn libvips
yarn global install n
n $(cat .node-version)
```

Then install the project's dependencies:

```
yarn
```

and start the local server:

```
yarn start
```

Let me (@bjacobel) know if you experience any installation errors with `libvips` or `sharp` - I have had intermittent issues with this component.

To test and develop some features locally you may need to add some environment variables. A list of current environment variables can be found in `.env.example`. To use variables, copy this file to `.env.development` and provide appropriate values. _Do not commit this file to source control._

### Testing

There are no unit/acceptance/integration tests ðŸ™ƒ For major upgrades, you should test at least the following:

- On a Netlify deploy preview
  - Creating a blog post and previewing it in the preview editor
    - [ ] Custom CSS
    - [ ] General styling issues
    - [ ] Uploading an image in the body
    - [ ] Uploading an image as the featured image
  - Social share text/images (using [Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/))
    - [ ] On a blog post
    - [ ] On a content page
- In local development:
  - [ ] Serving the app
  - [ ] Using local filesystem proxy for storage
