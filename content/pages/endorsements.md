My name is Sylvia Puglisi and I am running for Lebanon City Council. I am running because I would like to offer my skills and resources to the people of Lebanon. In the past years, I fell in love with this community of considerate, practically-minded and self-sufficient individuals who have such a strong history of local organizing, caring for their neighbors, and inspiring political interest and investment. The details of government are often opaque and technical, and I admire intensely the work done by current and former Lebanon civil servants to make the structure and work of governing accessible and understandable — from updates and outreach programs to face-to-face conversation and community organizing. I believe I have a lot to add to these efforts, and I would like to invest my time and energy for the next years into building more and better ways for Lebanon’s community to invest in itself!

As a life-long educator, I am dedicated to listening and learning. I believe strongly in these virtues as the essentials that support democracy: in classrooms, schools, workplaces, and communities. As a department head and school administrator, I faced the challenge of designing and implementing policies—when you propose to change the entire math curriculum of a high school, you find out in a hurry how many people are invested in it! Developing long-term plans critically requires input from the people that are affected, and not in a token way: you must structure the entire process around soliciting, listening to and integrating feedback, even if it diverts you from the fastest or easiest methods.

In a community as diverse as Lebanon, I believe it is crucial for elected officials to see themselves as representatives of all their constituents; one of my greatest motivations for running is the frustration of being excluded, of being cut out from the group of people that matter in the decision-making of my city. I aver to never dismiss or ignore Lebanon residents who are different than me—whose appearance, or family, or socioeconomic advantages don’t align with my expectations, whose values don’t align with mine. The work of politics is making decisions that other people may fairly disagree with: the easy way to handle disagreement is to dismiss your opponents as idiots, bad actors, or outsiders. I promise to take the hard way, of listening to those who think differently than me, doing my homework, and evaluating ideas sincerely on their merits and effects.

If elected, voters will have in me a dedicated worker who is focused on making the details of Lebanon local government clear to them. I am well-used to parsing through voluminous information, asking questions, and translating my understanding into tools that others can use to empower themselves. I am also an avid pedestrian, a supporter of local businesses and workers, a union member, a lover of mathematics, an amateur artist, and married to a hard-working and brilliant husband. I hope Lebanon voters will give me the opportunity to give my time to the City Council, as we all work through the next years’ challenges together!
