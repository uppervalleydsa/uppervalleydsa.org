# Organizing

The Upper Valley DSA is currently focused on several local organizing priorities. For more information or to get involved, [please contact us! ](https://uppervalleydsa.org/contact/)

### COVID-19

The current global pandemic is the defining issue of our times and it is abundantly clear that our heavily capitalist economic system is dangerous, oppressive, and designed only to serve the wealthy and powerful. 

DSA national has a bulletin for info, [click here to view](https://www.dsausa.org/news). There is also a [collaborative One-Stop Resources document ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f9qGDVbs7NfrhBCMVFQouiwU2b5Ew0scA3x6OzVNViM)that is being updated frequently. 

Upper Valley Response Team is coordinating mutual aid for the region. [Sign up](http://www.transformationalpractice.org/covid) to help, or request help for yourself or someone you know who is vulnerable or needs assistance. 

### Police and Prison Abolition

The Upper Valley Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America stands in solidarity with Black and Indigenous communities and organizations who call for the abolition of police and prisons. The United States was founded on stolen land and built with stolen labor. Police forces were created to protect the rights of white supremacy and serve the interests of racial capitalism, including by suppressing working-class strikes and enforcing Black Codes and Jim Crow. These violent and repressive roles assigned to policing continue today, including through state sanctioned police lynchings and millions of disproportionately Black and indigenous people locked into prison slavery. We say, “Enough!” As a necessary step towards decolonization and an end to capitalism, we call for the abolition of police and prisons.

The ultimate goal of the abolition of the police and prison industrial system is the creation of a society free from poverty, discrimination, and oppression, where crime is rare and approached as a problem of public health and where there is no need for a traditional police force or prison system. Towards this goal we seek an immediate reallocation of funding from police and prison budgets to the health, housing, library, social service, parks, and public works budgets that assist and lift up people in need and create livable communities for all. We further call on social service agencies to cease collaborating with police, insisting instead that communities in need are best and most safely supported by social service professionals. Seeking as well an end to the racist criminalization of undocumented workers, we call for an immediate halt to any collaboration between local and state governments and those on their employ with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol.

Another world is possible. Eliminating the power, control, and indeed the very existence of police and prisons is necessary to create it.

### Welcoming Communities

Upper Valley DSA is committed to supporting these initiatives in our local towns. We have helped push elected representatives to pass strong ordinances protecting immigrant communities and are committed to helping maintain these protections.
