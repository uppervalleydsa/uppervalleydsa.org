# Organizing

The Upper Valley DSA is currently focused on several local organizing priorities. For more information or to get involved, [please contact us! ](https://uppervalleydsa.org/contact/)

### COVID-19

The current global pandemic is the defining issue of our times and it is abundantly clear that our heavily capitalist economic system is dangerous, oppressive, and designed only to serve the wealthy and powerful. 

DSA national has a bulletin for info, [click here to view](https://www.dsausa.org/news). There is also a [collaborative One-Stop Resources document ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f9qGDVbs7NfrhBCMVFQouiwU2b5Ew0scA3x6OzVNViM)that is being updated frequently. 

Upper Valley Response Team is coordinating mutual aid for the region. [Sign up](http://www.transformationalpractice.org/covid) to help, or request help for yourself or someone you know who is vulnerable or needs assistance.
