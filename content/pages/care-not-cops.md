We are currently engaged in a campaign in Lebanon, NH to reallocate 50% of the police budget to other services that aid and support citizens. Please [read and sign our petition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-CIQ2TXU22NvmwqyUqVhepf-br9Y1l7B5ud1AG9ds9pWPVA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

![Care Not Cops proposal summary](/uploads/care-not-cops-proposal-summary.png)

We believe that the current City of Lebanon budget priorities--which allocate $6.9 million to the police while allocating only $560,000 to health and human services--do not reflect the values of our community.

We support reducing the police budget in Lebanon 50% by 2022 and reallocating the $3.45 million to social services provided by the city and local non-profits.

We believe re-allocating a portion of public funds from the police department will create a safer and healthier community by providing much-needed resources for senior services, substance abuse counseling, affordable housing, transportation, and other social services.

We urge members of the city council, as officials elected to represent and advocate for the interests of their community, to support a 50% police budget reallocation at the upcoming budget meeting.
