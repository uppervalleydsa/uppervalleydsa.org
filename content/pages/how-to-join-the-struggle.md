There are so many different ways to get involved. We are a broad, welcoming, inclusive organization, and your talents, enthusiasm, and efforts are needed for this very important work. 

**No experience is necessary**. The very nature of democratic socialism is that it is made up of the people. As citizen organizers, we reject the notion that political change comes from professional 'activists' and 'mobilizers'. We must bring about change for ourselves. 

We'll be hosting [orientation sessions every Tuesday in November and December at 7 PM on Zoom](/dsa101). PW: DSA101

All are welcome to our General Body Meetings, 2nd Monday of every month at 8 PM. [Contact us](/contact) for info. 

[Join our mailing list for updates](https://groups.google.com/g/upper-valley-dsa-bulletins/join)

Come to one of our Political Education events, like [Book Club](https://fb.me/e/37PzH5xM3), or [Socialist Night School](https://fb.me/e/4oCCw01wV) to learn more about Democratic Socialism. 

[Become a dues paying member of DSA](https://dsausa.org/join) - there's a sliding scale, so don't be intimidated. They'll send us your name eventually, but we'd rather [you reached out ](/contact)directly as well!

Ultimately, we hope you'll become an active organizer - get involved in one of our working groups, do research, recruit more members and organizers, take part in actions, mutual aid, and more! Build power, solidarity, and win for all.

Please reach out if you have questions, however it makes the most sense for you to do so. [Contact us today!](/contact)
