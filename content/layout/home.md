We are the Upper Valley chapter of the [Democratic Socialists of America](http://dsausa.org/), the largest socialist organization in the United States. Democratic Socialists believe that a democratically run economy and society—valuing human and environmental needs over greed and profit—is possible. As a political and activist organization, we fight to eradicate racism, sexism, Islamophobia, and the many forms of oppression that capitalism depends upon, and we fight for reforms to empower ordinary people and protect the planet.
