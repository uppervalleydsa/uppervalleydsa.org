# Make Sure Your Voice is Heard.

### Lebanon City Voting is Tuesday March 9.

This guide is prepared for the people of Lebanon by the Upper Valley DSA. We've gathered information from a number of official sources, to make it easier for you to cast your ballot in the coming city election.

To shift the distribution of power and wealth in our society, we need to start locally — ensuring the voices of working people and the oppressed are heard and respected, that our government supports the health of all citizens and actively works toward a sustainable local economy.

This year, the Upper Valley DSA [endorses](/endorsements) two Lebanon City Council candidates on the ballot, Sylvia Puglisi (At Large), and Devin Wilkie (Ward 2).

We also urge all Lebanon residents to support the School District Warrant Article 07, urging the board to [defund the School Resource Officer](https://www.vnews.com/Residents-petition-to-do-away-with-school-police-position-38319845).

<h2 id="how-to-register"> How to Register</h2>

If you've already registered to vote as a Lebanon resident in the past, you're all set to vote on March 9.

If you're unsure, you can check out [the State's Voter Information Lookup](https://app.sos.nh.gov/Public/PartyInfo.aspx). Select Lebanon from the Town or City field, then enter your name and birthday. (Warning: the page requires a CAPTCHA entry, which some people using accessibility tools may find difficult to navigate. If you need assistance, feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:uppervalleydsa@gmail.com) for help.)

#### For people who haven't yet registered, there are 3 main ways to get it done:

1. **Absentee Voting** If you're concerned about voting in person because of COVID-19, you can vote — and register to vote — using the Absentee Ballot process. Once you send in your completed Absentee Ballot Request (see below), the City Clerk's office will mail back a voter registration packet along with your ballot.

2. **Visit the City Clerk's Office** They're open from 7-5 Monday - Thursday at the lower level of Town Hall. Masks are required, and they have some available if needed.
   You can also call the City Clerk's office at 603-448-3054 and they'll mail out a registration packet to you. Good option for those who plan on voting in person on the 9th.

3. **Same-Day Registration** New Hampshire allows residents to register _and_ vote at their polling location on Election Day. You'll need to determine your polling location (based on your Ward, see below), and will need to bring the required documents from the lists below.

### What You'll Need

To register to vote, you'll fill out a voter registration card and present proof of identity, citizenship, age, and residency in Lebanon. If you don't have proof of citizenship, you'll be asked to complete a qualified voter affidavit.

Documents that prove your indentity include driver's license, birth certificate, passport, or any photo identification. The licence, birth certificate and passport are also valid for proving your age.

Proving Lebanon residency requires one of the following documents:

- NH Driver’s license or non-driver’s license
- Another government-issued form of identification
- NH auto-registration
- Dated rent receipt or lease agreement
- Dated pay stub or utility bill
- Water/sewer or property tax bill
- Hunting or fishing license
- Bank statement
- State or Federal tax form
- If you live in an assisted living facility, you can provide a written statement on letterhead attesting to your residency
- And, if you can't provide any of these, you can sign a Domicile Affidavit with the City Clerk's office.

<h2 id="absentee">Voting with an Absentee Ballot</h2>

If you're about voting in person during the COVID-19 pandemic, you can fill out Lebanon's [Absentee Ballot Application](https://lebanonnh.gov/DocumentCenter/View/825/Absentee-Ballot-Request-Form-PDF).

Be sure to:

- Check off the box on the form that says "I am unable to vote due to a disability".
- Sign the form. An unsigned request for an absentee ballot won't be considered valid.
- Complete the rest of the form and return it to the City Clerk's office.

You can email the completed application to <cityclerk@lebanonnh.gov>, or mail it to:

> City Clerk’s Office <br>
> 51 N Park Street <br>
> Lebanon, NH 03766

There's no official deadline for filing your request, but it's important to plan for enough time file your request, receive the Absentee Ballot by mail, and then return it to the City Clerk's office — all in advance of the March 9 election!

You can also return your ballot in-person at your polling location on Election Day. Locate an official greeter if you don't want to enter the building.

And once you've returned your ballot, you can use New Hampshire's [Voter Information Look-up website](https://app.sos.nh.gov/Public/AbsenteeBallot.aspx) to check on the status of your absentee ballot.

More information is available at [here](https://lebanonnh.gov/564/Absentee-Ballots-Voting) at the City Clerk's website.
