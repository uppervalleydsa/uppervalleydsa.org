Lebanon officials are in active discussions with other Upper Valley communities over a plan to provide a [regional mobile mental health crisis unit](https://www.vnews.com/Upper-Valley-towns-work-to-create-social-worker-position-39244069). Similar programs have proven to be very effective in providing safer and more effective first responses to mental health emergencies and other non-violent personal crises than the police can. The oft-cited [CAHOOTS program](https://whitebirdclinic.org/what-is-cahoots/) in Eugene, OR responds to thousands of calls per year, diverting approximately 20% of 911 calls away from police. 

The finer details of the proposed Upper Valley program are yet to be released. It's unclear at this point if the intention is to have the social worker accompany police or be the solitary responder
