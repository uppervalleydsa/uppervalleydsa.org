If you’re a socialist, last week’s political news might have felt like a gut punch.

On Wednesday, in the middle of a nationwide uprising against police violence, Joe Biden selected [former prosecutor and “top cop” Kamala Harris](https://www.democracynow.org/2020/8/12/joe_biden_kamala_harris_vp_pick) as his running mate for President of the United States. The following day, reporting revealed that [the Massachusetts Democratic Party helped coordinate an attack](https://prospect.org/power/richard-neal-number-one-in-corporate-pac-donations/) against Alex Morse, a progressive primary challenger who is running against Richard Neal, [the number one recipient of corporate PAC money in Congress](https://prospect.org/power/richard-neal-number-one-in-corporate-pac-donations/).

Watching the Democratic Party try to snuff out leftist candidates at the national level can make you feel powerless, especially when mainstream liberals push a narrative that political work only happens a few times a year on election days. As socialists, we believe that organizing is a year-round activity. Participating in local political work can be often more impactful and empowering because fewer people get involved at the municipal and state level.
