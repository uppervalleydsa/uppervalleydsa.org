On June 13th, 2023, residents of Twin Pines Housing Trust (TPHT) properties (with support from allied TPHT members and the Upper Valley Tenants Union) took action to secure proper resident representation on the TPHT Board of Trustees. Residents organized this action in response to longstanding complaints about our living conditions and treatment by management at Twin Pines properties. The main goal of this action was to appoint more Twin Pines residents to the Board of Trustees so that residents have more say in the management of TPHT properties.

Thanks to the TPHT residents and members who attended the Annual Meeting, we were able to achieve our goals of appointing four more residents to the Board of Trustees . We are optimistic that this victory will provide us with a stronger voice in how TPHT properties are managed and will help remedy longstanding property management issues that have gone unaddressed by TPHT leadership. These issues include:

* Unsanitary and unsafe living conditions, including black mold and raw sewage entering resident apartments for weeks without being addressed by management
* Sexual assault and violence committed against both women and children on property with no management intervention or plans to relocate traumatized individuals
* HVAC issues that exacerbate chronic health conditions, including causing individuals to pass out, with inequitable and inadequate distribution of air conditioning units in the warmer months
* Willful ignorance and stubbornness from management in addressing how to make units accessible for tenants with disabilities
* Shoddy construction, electrical, and plumbing, including frequent electrical outages, leaks in sinks, “temporary” appliances that have not been replaced in years, etc.
* Retaliation against residents who speak up about issues.

This action was based on a simple premise: we deserve to live in clean, safe, affordable, and harassment-free homes. Sadly, TPHT leadership has repeatedly failed us in this regard. It has become clear that if we are to have consistently safe and stable homes, we must force TPHT leadership to do what is right, both now and in the future, and secure more control over how our homes are managed.

This action was made possible by the organizing efforts of TPHT residents. We encourage other residents who are interested in making change to join us by contacting the Upper Valley Tenants Union ([uvtenantsunion@gmail.com](mailto:uvtenantsunion@gmail.com)) and asking to get involved.
